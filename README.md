# environmental-contamination
##Objective:
Create a visual tool that tracks harmful chemicals and attributes to nearby companies for purposes of accountability to EPA regulations. 

##Questions to tackle:
  - Filter data for most dangerous chemicals and create a line graph to represent how the concentration has changed over time with a selector for specific chemical.
  - Create a heatmap showing where these chemicals are geographically located along the river and include animation of how concentration has changed. 
  - Who/what is responsible for this?
    - Location of these companies overlaid on map of chemical concentrations

##Breakdown of Tasks:
  Each one of us will select two contaminants to analyze and map. 
  Steps:
  - Set up repository
  - Pull all datasets related to Passaic River (not Newark Bay) and put in repository
  - Extract each chemical’s data from all year’s datasets
  - Concatenate time-series data for each chemical
  - Clean data for chemical name, date, concentration, and geo coordinates
  - Make a heatmap of concentrations of that chemical for each year
